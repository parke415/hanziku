# **Hanziku (漢字庫)**
> "Gotta (Re-)Learn 'Em All!" - Andrew Parke

*Hanziku* is an app that makes it fun and convenient to collect characters as you learn them—great for students of Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, and even Vietnamese!

## *Getting Started:*
* Sign up or log in with your Hanziku account.
* Click on the "Add" link in the navigation bar to add your first character.
* Fill out the character's basic properties following the prompt.
* Detailed properties are added automatically—you may edit them at any time.
* By default, newly added characters are not yet learned; mark a character as learned by clicking on the character's tile in the details view.
* You may filter your character list according to learned status using the links in the navigation bar.
* Click [**here**](https://hanziku.herokuapp.com/) to enter the world of hanzi! ([view project planning](https://trello.com/b/nxvpoQ6C/hanziku))
